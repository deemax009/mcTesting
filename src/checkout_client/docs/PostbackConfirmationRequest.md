**correlationId** | **String** | A unique identifier that correlates a series of two or more requests to a single session of activity. Unified Checkout Solutions (UCS) will return a new correlationId in each response by default, but Integrators may choose to populate previously used correlationIds in subsequent requests to correlate their activity under a single ID. This can be done by providing a Mastercard generated correlationId in the request, or by generating your own ID in the same format. correlationId is used for tracking and troubleshooting purposes within Mastercard&#39;s ecosystem. | 
**merchantTransactionId** | **String** | An optional UUID generated by the Integrator that may be passed for internal tracking purposes. | [optional] 
**confirmationData** | [**ConfirmationData**](ConfirmationData.md) |  |
