/**
 * Mastercard Processing Core API
 * OpenAPI Specification for MP (Mastercard Processing) **Core**.  This documentation describes what functionalities are exposed by the MP's CMS (Card Management System) and are available to be used by the Issuer. The Issuer is the primary actor who executes the operations. Whenever the Issuer wishes to onboard its customers to the card program, they may use API to:  * create and manage **client**  * create and manage **contracts**, there are two types of contracts in the MP's CMS:    * **account contract**    * **card contract**  Later, during the card lifecycle, the Issuer can also manage other objects related to the client and the contract (account or card):  * manage **card plastic**  * create, manage and retrieve **additional addresses** (for the client and the contract)  * manage and retrieve **classifiers** (for the client and the contract)  * manage and retrieve **custom data** (for the client and the contract)  * manage and retrieve **parameters** (for the contract)  * set or retrieve **service limit tariff** (for the contract)  * post or retrieve **transactions** (for the contract)  * manage and retrieve **usage limits** (for the contract)  *** API uses RESTful protocol via HTTP to execute POST, PUT, GET and PATCH operations sent to given endpoints, e.g. `/clients`.  API uses JSON Web Encryption compact serialization for payload encryption for all API operations. *** External documentation:   * [ISO 4217 - Currency Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html)   * [ISO 3166 - Country Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)   * [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) BCP 47 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#appendix-A)   * [JSON Web Encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/platform/documentation/security-and-authentication/securing-sensitive-data-using-payload-encryption/#jwe-encryption)   * [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232)   * [JSON Merge Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) ***

    /**
     * Adds or updates a usage limit for a given contract (account contract or card contract)
     * Operation name: `setUsageLimit`  Operation is used to add or update a new usage limit for the contract (**account contract** or **card contract**).  MP API does not provide an option to create a new usage limit. Usage limits are defined during the setup phase of the product (card product). Each usage limit has default values stored on CMS configuration (Service Pack). Operation `setUsageLimit` allows to update those default values of a given usage limit for the specified contract. The updated values are immediately used in authorization checks.  Specifics of a combination of limit properties (`maxNumber`, `maxAmount`, `maxSingleAmount`) parameters:   * Limit could be active (after overriding by `setUsageLimit`) with all 0 which means that all transactions belonging     to this limit will be declined. If all three fields have zero values, all transactions are prohibited.   * If at least one property is set to non-zero, the limit will allow transactions up to that number or amount respectively.   * If at least one property is set to a big number (ex. `maxNumber` set to 999999999 which is unlikely to reach in normal circumstances),     it will serve the same purpose as disabling limit.  **Examples:** 1.  *`maxNumber`=0, `maxAmount`=1000, `maxSingleAmount`=200*      In this configuration, no limit is set on the total number of transactions (maxNumber) on a contract for a period.     The total transaction amount for a period (maxAmount) and single transaction amount (maxSingleAmount) are limited.  2.  *`maxNumber`=10, `maxAmount`=0, `maxSingleAmount`=200*      In this configuration, the total number of transactions on a contract for a period and single transaction amount are limited.     No limit is set on the total transaction amount for a period.  3.  *`maxNumber`=10, `maxAmount`=1000, `maxSingleAmount`=0*      In this configuration, the total number of transactions on a contract and the total transaction amount for a period are limited.     No limit is set on the single transaction amount.  Note: If limiter parameters were changed several times, and the effective periods of the redefined parameters overlap, the system remembers the changed values in the overlapping time periods. For example:   * On 01.10.2009 a card was opened for a client. A limit of 300 USD was set on this card for operations at ATMs.   * The client requested that for a period of one month, beginning 05.10.2009, the limit on his card be increased from 300 USD to 600 USD.   * On 10.10.2009 the client asked to increase the limit on his card from 600 USD to 900 USD for one day.   * Therefore, from 01.10.2009 to 04.10.2009 the limit will be 300 USD, from 05.10.2009 to 09.10.2009 it will increase to 600 USD,     on 10.10.2009 it will be 900 USD, and from 11.10.2009 to 05.11.2009 the limit will be 600 USD again. After 05.11.2009 the limit will return to 300 USD.  Available usage limits in the standard product.
