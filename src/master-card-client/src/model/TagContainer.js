/**
 * Mastercard Processing Core API
 * OpenAPI Specification for MP (Mastercard Processing) **Core**.  This documentation describes what functionalities are exposed by the MP's CMS (Card Management System) and are available to be used by the Issuer. The Issuer is the primary actor who executes the operations. Whenever the Issuer wishes to onboard its customers to the card program, they may use API to:  * create and manage **client**  * create and manage **contracts**, there are two types of contracts in the MP's CMS:    * **account contract**    * **card contract**  Later, during the card lifecycle, the Issuer can also manage other objects related to the client and the contract (account or card):  * manage **card plastic**  * create, manage and retrieve **additional addresses** (for the client and the contract)  * manage and retrieve **classifiers** (for the client and the contract)  * manage and retrieve **custom data** (for the client and the contract)  * manage and retrieve **parameters** (for the contract)  * set or retrieve **service limit tariff** (for the contract)  * post or retrieve **transactions** (for the contract)  * manage and retrieve **usage limits** (for the contract)  *** API uses RESTful protocol via HTTP to execute POST, PUT, GET and PATCH operations sent to given endpoints, e.g. `/clients`.  API uses JSON Web Encryption compact serialization for payload encryption for all API operations. *** External documentation:   * [ISO 4217 - Currency Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html)   * [ISO 3166 - Country Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html)   * [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) BCP 47 standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#appendix-A)   * [JSON Web Encryption](https://developer.mastercard.com/platform/documentation/security-and-authentication/securing-sensitive-data-using-payload-encryption/#jwe-encryption)   * [Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232)   * [JSON Merge Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386) ***
