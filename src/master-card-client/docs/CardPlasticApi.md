## activateCard

> activateCard(cardContractId, cardContractActivation)

Activates a card plastic and unlocks the card for transaction use.

Operation name: &#x60;activateCard&#x60;  Operation is used to activate a card plastic for transaction use. When a new card contract is created, usually a card plastic is produced with the status &#x60;Locked&#x60; to prevent the card from unauthorized transactions. If the card plastic status is &#x60;Locked&#x60;, the cardholder is not able to perform any transactions as they will be rejected. Plastic activation unlocks the plastic and allows the cardholder to use it in POS, e-commerce, ATM, etc. 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.CardPlasticApi();
let cardContractId = 70001; // Number | Unique technical identifier for a card contract generated by the MP's CMS. The identifier is generated when card contract creation finishes successfully and is returned in a card contract creation response (`POST /cards`). 
let cardContractActivation = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.CardContractActivation(); // CardContractActivation | 
apiInstance.activateCard(cardContractId, cardContractActivation, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
});
```

### Parameters

## getCardPlastics

> CardContractPlastics getCardPlastics(cardContractId)

Retrieves information about all card plastics for a specified card contract

Operation name: &#x60;getCardPlastics&#x60;  Operation is used to retrieve information about all card plastics created under a specified card contract.  Each card plastic has a sequential number assigned. The card plastic number sequence starts with 1 and is increased by 1 for each reissued card, whenever a new card plastic is created under the same card contract. 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.CardPlasticApi();
let cardContractId = 70001; // Number | Unique technical identifier for a card contract generated by the MP's CMS. The identifier is generated when card contract creation finishes successfully and is returned in a card contract creation response (`POST /cards`).

## getPin

> EncryptedPin getPin(cardContractId, customerPublicRsaKey, pinSearchCriteria, opts)

Retrieves a PIN for a card plastic

Operation name: &#x60;getPin&#x60;  Operation is used to retrieve from MP&#39;s CMS the PIN defined for given card plastic (in the CMS card plastic exists also for a virtual card - card plastic is not always a physical card).  Note: If there is more than one card plastic with the same value of expiry date then the CMS system retrieves the PIN from the plastic which is currently treated as active by the CMS system.  The PIN is always retrieved in a secured way - asymmetric encryption is used. MP will encrypt the PIN returned in the response with public RSA key passed in request message in the &#x60;Customer-Public-Rsa-Key&#x60; header. The Public RSA key will be generated by the Issuer and the Issuer will have a matching private key that can be used to decrypt the PIN value.  Note: Apart from above symmetric encryption payload JWE encryption is used. 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.CardPlasticApi();
let cardContractId = 70001; // Number | Unique technical identifier for a card contract generated by the MP's CMS. The identifier is generated when card contract creation finishes successfully and is returned in a card contract creation response (`POST /cards`).

## reissueCard

> ReissuedCardContract reissueCard(cardContractId, cardContractReissue, opts)

Reissues a card

Operation name: &#x60;reissueCard&#x60;  Operation is used to create a new card plastic object for a given card contract. By triggering the operation, the Issuer may execute the following cases:   * issue a physical card for a virtual card   * reissue an existing card (duplicate physical card, e.g. due to damage, ...)   * renew an existing card   * replace an existing card  In each case, a new card plastic object is created for a given card contract and the card plastic sequential number for the new object is incremented by 1.  Note: &#x60;newCardContractNumber&#x60; is not used when:   * &#x60;reissueType&#x60; defines that a new card contract is not created (only a new &#x60;Plastic&#x60; is created under the same card contract)   * &#x60;reissueType&#x60; defines that a card contract will be replaced with a PIN inheritance (the MP&#39;s CMS generates &#x60;newCardContractNumber&#x60; in this case) 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.CardPlasticApi();
let cardContractId = 70001; // Number | Unique technical identifier for a card contract generated by the MP's CMS. The identifier is generated when card contract creation finishes successfully and is returned in a card contract creation response (`POST /cards`).

## setPin

> setPin(cardContractId, pinCreation, opts)

Sets up new PIN for a card plastic

Operation name: &#x60;setPin&#x60;  Operation is used to set PIN for a card plastic. The card must have a PIN defined before a physical card is produced. MP&#39;s CMS does not validate the old PIN.  The Issuer is not allowed to send PIN value in clear text, instead, a PIN block shall be sent. Additionally, the PIN block must be encrypted.  The following encryption options are allowed:   * **Symmetric** - a PIN block is secured with a ZPK (Zone Pin Key, exchanged with MP during the onboarding process).        When the ZPK encryption is used, the PIN block must be in ISO format 0.   * **Asymmetric** - a PIN block is secured with a public RSA key received from MP&#39;s CMS in &#x60;GET /public-keys&#x60; response (API operation: &#x60;getPublicRsaKey&#x60;).        When the public RSA key encryption is used, the PIN block may be in ISO format 0 or format 1 (depending on the MP API configuration). In such case, the PIN block length is up to 2048 characters. A permitted value format is an ASCII/UTF-8 string of characters 0-9,A-F (ASN.1 DER cryptogram hex unpacked to string).  Note: Apart from the above encryption (symmetric or asymmetric) payload JWE encryption is used.  PIN block ISO formats usage:   * **ISO-0 format** is used when full &#x60;cardContractNumber&#x60;(PAN) is known to the Issuer (usually for PCI-compliant Issuers).   * **ISO-1 format** is used when full &#x60;cardContractNumber&#x60;(PAN) is not known to the Issuer (usually for non-PCI-compliant Issuers). 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.CardPlasticApi();
let cardContractId = 70001; // Number | Unique technical identifier for a card contract generated by the MP's CMS. The identifier is generated when card contract creation finishes successfully and is returned in a card contract creation response (`POST /cards`). 
let pinCreation = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.PinCreation(); // PinCreation | 
let opts = {
  'keyIndex': "A1564386531162" // String | Index of the MP's public RSA key received in a `GET /public-keys` response (API operation: `getPublicRsaKey`).  If `Key-Index` is provided, then the `newPinBlock` field must be encrypted using the MP's public RSA key received together with the `Key-Index` from the MP in `GET /public-keys` response (API operation: `getPublicRsaKey`). 
};
apiInstance.setPin(cardContractId, pinCreation, opts, (error, data, response) => {
