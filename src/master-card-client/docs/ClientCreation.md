**clientContactData** | [**ClientContactData**](ClientContactData.md) |  | [optional]

**clientCustomData** | [**[CustomDataTag]**](CustomDataTag.md) | Client custom data allow the Issuer to pass specific client tags during the creation request. The tags may represent Issuer-specific field names and values, not available as separate, dedicated fields. The Issuer can specify a tag name and its value.  Custom data tags are stored in fixed containers (four containers are available) in a TAG&#x3D;VALUE; format (for example: CATEGORY&#x3D;A;GROUP&#x3D;G1;).  Each container has a length of 3900 characters.  | [optional] 
**clientNumber** | **String** | Client&#39;s identifier generated by the Issuer&#39;s CBS system (Core Banking System). The identifier is stored in the MP&#39;s CMS so that - apart from the technical identifier &#x60;clientId&#x60; - the Issuer can distinguish between their customers.  &#x60;clientNumber&#x60; should be prefixed with a unique Issuer designation, for example \&quot;ABC_\&quot;, as it must be unique in the MP&#39;s CMS.  Note: The Issuer designation \&quot;ABC_\&quot; is configured in the MP&#39;s CMS and the Issuer is allowed to use only the value agreed with the MP.  | 
**clientType** | **String** | Client type.  | **Possible values**  | **Description**        | |--------------------- |----------------------- | | PNR                  | Private NonResident    | | PR                   | Private Resident       | | CR                   | Corporate Resident     | | CNR                  | Corporate NonResident  |  Notes:   * The field cannot be freely used because the client type has an impact on many CMS internal procedures. The Issuer must always agree with the MP which value should be used (in most cases \&quot;PR\&quot; is the default value)   * Please contact the MP representative should a value different than \&quot;PR\&quot; be needed, as using it requires configuration on the MP&#39;s side.  | 
**orderDepartment** | **String** | Department accepting the creation request on the Issuer&#39;s side. The value can be later used by the Issuer for reporting purposes.  *Disclaimer: Please contact MP&#39;s representative should new values be required.* Available values will need to be agreed upon by the MP and the Issuer prior to the onboarding process as they need to be configured on the MP&#39;s side.  | [optional] 
**serviceGroupCode** | **String** | Service groups are an additional client and contract classifier. For example, according to additional classification, VIP clients can be distinguished as a separate group. Service groups can be used to configure various filters for viewing data or generating reports.  *Disclaimer: Please contact the MP representative should new values be required. Available values will need to be agreed upon by the MP and the Issuer prior to the onboarding process as they need to be configured on the MP&#39;s side.*  | [optional]
