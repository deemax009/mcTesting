Retrieves transaction documents for a contract (account contract or card contract)

Operation name: &#x60;getContractTransactionDocuments&#x60;  Operation is used to retrieve transaction documents for a specified contract (**account contract** or **card contract**).

This option is similar to 'A' but excludes closed and declined authorizations.   * U - authorizations that lead to a contract's balance changes and cardholder's requests that do not change a contract's balance. Closed and declined authorizations are considered too.

 **dateFrom** | **Date**| Date from (YYYY-MM-DD format).  | 
 **dateTo** | **Date**| Date to (YYYY-MM-DD format).  | 
 **authorizationFilterMode** | **String**| Specifies records filtering mode.  | **Possible values**  | **Description**                    | |--------------------- |----------------------------------- | | A                    | Not Matched Affecting Balance      | | N                    | Not Affecting Balance              | | S                    | Successful Only Affecting Balance  | | U                    | All Records                        |  Depending on its value the following authorizations are output:   * A (default value) - authorizations that lead to a contract&#39;s balance changes and haven&#39;t matched with financial documents (they are waiting for financial documents or already closed or declined).   * N - cardholder&#39;s requests not changing a contract&#39;s balance (Balance Inquiry, Online Statement, Top Up, Additional Online Service, Verification).   * S - active authorizations that lead to a contract&#39;s balance changes, waiting for a financial document to be matched. This option is similar to &#39;A&#39; but excludes closed and declined authorizations.   * U - authorizations that lead to a contract&#39;s balance changes and cardholder&#39;s requests that do not change a contract&#39;s balance.

## getTransactions

> Transactions getTransactions(contractId, dateFrom, dateTo, opts)

Retrieves transactions for a specified contract (account contract or card contract)

Operation name: &#x60;getTransactions&#x60;  Operation is used to retrieve transactions for a specified contract (**account contract** or **card contract**).  Additional filtering can be applied:   * **Date from** - to define the start period   * **Date to** - to define the end period   * **Authorization filter mode** - to retrieve records with different impact on contract balance   * **Authorized flag** - to retrieve records which were authorized or not   * **Transaction type code** - to retrieve transactions of a specified type  Note: Date filters use CMS \&quot;transaction date\&quot; (&#x60;transactionDate&#x60; field) to filter the records.

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.TransactionApi();
let contractId = 70001; // Number | Unique technical contract identifier generated by the CMS.  The identifier is generated when contract (account or card) creation finishes successfully and is returned in:   * account contract creation response (`POST /accounts`, field: `accountContractId`).   * card contract creation response (`POST /cards`, field: `cardContractId`). 
let dateFrom = new Date("2031-06-25"); // Date | Date from (YYYY-MM-DD format). 
let dateTo = new Date("2032-06-25"); // Date | Date to (YYYY-MM-DD format). 
let opts = {
  'authorizationFilterMode': "A", // String | Specifies records filtering mode.  | **Possible values**  | **Description**                    | |--------------------- |----------------------------------- | | A                    | Not Matched Affecting Balance      | | N                    | Not Affecting Balance              | | S                    | Successful Only Affecting Balance  | | U                    | All Records                        |  Depending on its value the following authorizations are output:   * A (default value) - authorizations that lead to a contract's balance changes and haven't matched with financial documents (they are waiting for financial documents or already closed or declined).   * N - cardholder's requests not changing a contract's balance (Balance Inquiry, Online Statement, Top Up, Additional Online Service, Verification).   * S - active authorizations that lead to a contract's balance changes, waiting for a financial document to be matched. This option is similar to 'A' but excludes closed and declined authorizations.   * U - authorizations that lead to a contract's balance changes and cardholder's requests that do not change a contract's balance. Closed and declined authorizations are considered too. 
  'authorized': "Y", // String | Determines whether the transaction was authorized. 
  'limit': 1, // Number | The number of items you want the list to be limited to.

### Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **contractId** | **Number**| Unique technical contract identifier generated by the CMS.  The identifier is generated when contract (account or card) creation finishes successfully and is returned in:   * account contract creation response (&#x60;POST /accounts&#x60;, field: &#x60;accountContractId&#x60;).   * card contract creation response (&#x60;POST /cards&#x60;, field: &#x60;cardContractId&#x60;).  | 
 **dateFrom** | **Date**| Date from (YYYY-MM-DD format).  | 
 **dateTo** | **Date**| Date to (YYYY-MM-DD format).  | 
 **authorizationFilterMode** | **String**| Specifies records filtering mode.  | **Possible values**  | **Description**                    | |--------------------- |----------------------------------- | | A                    | Not Matched Affecting Balance      | | N                    | Not Affecting Balance              | | S                    | Successful Only Affecting Balance  | | U                    | All Records                        |  Depending on its value the following authorizations are output:   * A (default value) - authorizations that lead to a contract&#39;s balance changes and haven&#39;t matched with financial documents (they are waiting for financial documents or already closed or declined).   * N - cardholder&#39;s requests not changing a contract&#39;s balance (Balance Inquiry, Online Statement, Top Up, Additional Online Service, Verification).   * S - active authorizations that lead to a contract&#39;s balance changes, waiting for a financial document to be matched. This option is similar to &#39;A&#39; but excludes closed and declined authorizations.   * U - authorizations that lead to a contract&#39;s balance changes and cardholder&#39;s requests that do not change a contract&#39;s balance. Closed and declined authorizations are considered too.  | [optional] [default to &#39;A&#39;]
 **authorized** | **String**| Determines whether the transaction was authorized.  | [optional] 
 **limit** | **Number**| The number of items you want the list to be limited to.  | [optional] [default to 10]

## reverseTransaction

> ReverseTransactionId reverseTransaction(transactionId, reverseTransactionReason, opts)

Reverses selected transaction made by the Issuer.

Operation name: &#x60;reverseTransaction&#x60;  Operation is used to reverse selected transaction made by the Issuer. Transaction types that can be reversed must be preconfigured in the CMS during the onboarding process.  The transaction which can be reversed must be in posting status &#x60;Posted&#x60;. After a successful transaction reversal, the proper balance will be changed. 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.TransactionApi();
let transactionId = 90001; // Number | Transaction record id from the CMS system. 
let reverseTransactionReason = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.ReverseTransactionReason(); // ReverseTransactionReason | 
let opts = {
  'idempotencyKey': "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70" // String | Unique identifier generated by the issuer. Mastercard Processing uses this identifier to recognize subsequent retries of the same request and ensure idempotent behaviour by sending the same response without repeating the operation again. 
};
apiInstance.reverseTransaction(transactionId, reverseTransactionReason, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
