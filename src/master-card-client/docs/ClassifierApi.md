### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.ClassifierApi();
let classifierCodes = ["TEST_CLASSIFIER_01"]; // [String] | The list of classifiers which should be returned.  Note: Response will contain only specified classifier codes that does exist in the CMS. If none exists or a list does not contain any value then the response will not return any data (HTTP 200 will be returned with an empty array `[]`).  *Disclaimer: Possible values which can be sent must be defined by MP and Issuer during the onboarding process.* 
let clientId = 40000; // Number | Unique technical client identifier, generated by the MP's CMS database engine. The identifier is generated when client creation finishes successfully and is returned in a client creation response (`POST /clients`, field `clientId`). 
apiInstance.getClientClassifiers(classifierCodes, clientId, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
  }
});

## setClientClassifier

> setClientClassifier(clientId, classifierCode, classifierCreation)

Sets up a client classifier

Operation name: &#x60;setClientClassifier&#x60;  Operation is used to set client classifier value.  Classifiers are a mechanism for storing configuration parameters. Represent rules or restrictions allowing flexible configuration of business processes:   * Classifiers make it possible to segment clients into groups depending on the current status of a client   * Classifiers make it possible to set conditions for executing various actions, depending on the current status of a client  For example, a client classifier can be used to mark the client as a migrated client. 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.ClassifierApi();
let clientId = 40000; // Number | Unique technical client identifier, generated by the MP's CMS database engine. The identifier is generated when client creation finishes successfully and is returned in a client creation response (`POST /clients`, field `clientId`). 
let classifierCode = "TEST_CLASSIFIER_01"; // String | Code of the classifier for which the value will be set.  *Disclaimer: Classifier codes are configured in the MP's CMS and the Issuer is allowed to use only the value configured by the MP (the Issuer cannot use their own values).* 
let classifierCreation = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.ClassifierCreation(); // ClassifierCreation | 
apiInstance.setClientClassifier(clientId, classifierCode, classifierCreation, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
});

### Example

```javascript

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.ClassifierApi();
let contractId = 70001; // Number | Unique technical contract identifier generated by the CMS.  The identifier is generated when contract (account or card) creation finishes successfully and is returned in:   * account contract creation response (`POST /accounts`, field: `accountContractId`).   * card contract creation response (`POST /cards`, field: `cardContractId`). 
let classifierCode = "TEST_CLASSIFIER_01"; // String | Code of the classifier for which the value will be set.  *Disclaimer: Classifier codes are configured in the MP's CMS and the Issuer is allowed to use only the value configured by the MP (the Issuer cannot use their own values).* 
let classifierCreation = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.ClassifierCreation(); // ClassifierCreation | 
apiInstance.setContractClassifier(contractId, classifierCode, classifierCreation, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
