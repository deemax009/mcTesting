## addClientAddress

> addClientAddress(clientId, addressCreation, opts)

Creates an address for a client

Operation name: &#x60;addClientAddress&#x60;  Operation is used to add an additional address for a specified client object.  MP&#39;s CMS allows to store many additional addresses related to the client. Each address type which will be added must be predefined in the CMS system.  The additional address can be used to store for example:   * statement delivery address.   * PIN mailer delivery address. 

### Example

```javascript
import MastercardProcessingCoreApi from 'mastercard_processing_core_api';

let apiInstance = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.AddressApi();
let clientId = 40000; // Number | Unique technical client identifier, generated by the MP's CMS database engine. The identifier is generated when client creation finishes successfully and is returned in a client creation response (`POST /clients`, field `clientId`). 
let addressCreation = new MastercardProcessingCoreApi.AddressCreation(); // AddressCreation | 
let opts = {
  'idempotencyKey': "7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70" // String | Unique identifier generated by the issuer. Mastercard Processing uses this identifier to recognize subsequent retries of the same request and ensure idempotent behaviour by sending the same response without repeating the operation again. 
};
apiInstance.addClientAddress(clientId, addressCreation, opts, (error, data, response) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log('API called successfully.');
  }
